MK-Debugout is a class to help with debugging code
while and after writing it. 
It's main strength is the support of so-called "Debug scopes":
Each possible debug output is in a named scope. Each scope
can be activated or deactivated by the program itself or
(preferrably) by a debugconfig-file.
If this class (and header) is included, it supplies another
outputstream called "dout" (for debugout). Output to this stream
is printed to cout if the surrounding scope is activated.

Config file for doxygen is included. Please use this to create
further documentation. Also douttest.cc shows some common use-cases.

To use this class, declare PATH_TO_DEBUGOUT in your Makefile
and include $(PATH_TO_DEBUGOUT)Makefile.inc.
Afterwards, the objects OBJ_DEBUGOUT and OBJ_DEBUGNOUT will be
defined and have rules. Use OBJ_DEBUGNOUT to disable all output but
still have the dout-functions defined.

Please note that using mk-debugout creates further overhead even with
the empty functions in OBJ_DEBUGNOUT. If memory usage or running time
are critical, other debug options (having no traces when disabled) should
be used.
